# Point-of-Sale-POS-System-in-C
A console-based Point of Sale (POS) simulator built in C language that manages an inventory using a Binary Search Tree (BST) and customer purchases through a linked list-based cart system. This project demonstrates data structures, input validation, and functional modular programming in C — all within an interactive menu-driven application.
